# PS3 Discord Rich Presence
Adds Discord rich presence to your PS3 without relying on PSN.


Add your PS3 local IP to __config.json__ and run the script! 


@FMudanyali added a feature that allows you to switch between temps and the firmware of your console (0 means it won’t show your temps, 1 means it will show them).


# Requirements

- python3 and pip3 on your computer

**Dependencies**

- bs4
- python3-requests
- pypresence


install them like so:

`pip3 install bs4 requests pypresence --user`
